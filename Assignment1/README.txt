To run the code, you have to run the __main__ in A1code.py in the IDE you prefer, the input images should be in the same
folder as A1code.py. The code will save the output images in the same folder as the python file. For plotting gaussian
adn LoG, the number following letter s in the name of the output image indicate the size of the image and number behind
"sig" indicate the sigma of the kernel in the image. For example: Gaussian_2D_s15_sig2.png is a image of a Gaussian kernel
with size = 15 and sigma = 2. Image of LoG kernel follows the same naming convention. To run picture of your own, please refer
to the first two line of __main__ in A1code.py file.
